---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Prep Time: 30 minutes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Ingredients:
        - 200g spaghetti
        - 2 large eggs
        - 50g pecorino cheese
        - 50g pancetta
        - 2 cloves garlic
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Steps:
        1. Cook spaghetti in a pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente.
        2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and grated pecorino cheese until well combined. Set aside.
        3. In a separate pan, cook diced pancetta until crispy. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant.
        4. Once spaghetti is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with pancetta and garlic. Remove from heat.
        5. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot spaghetti and toss everything together until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta evenly.
        6. Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated pecorino cheese and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.
